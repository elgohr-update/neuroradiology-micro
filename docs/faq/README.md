## FAQ

The FAQ should provide quick answers to the most common questions.

## What is Micro?

Micro is a platform for cloud native development.

## Is it open source?

Micro is open source but makes use of the Polyform Shield license to protect against AWS running it as a managed service.

### Where's the Community

There's a slack community with thousands of members. Invite yourself at [slack.micro.mu](https://slack.micro.mu).

## Who's using Micro?

See the [users](../users) page with a list of companies using Micro (but note it may be out of date). 

## Where can I run Micro?

Micro is runtime agnostic. You can run it anywhere you like. On bare metal, on AWS, Google Cloud. On your favourite container orchestration system like Mesos or Kubernetes.

## Does Micro support gRPC?

Yes. In v2 and beyond micro makes use of gRPC by default.

## What's the difference between Micro and Go Micro?

Go Micro was an early attempt at building a framework for Go microservices development. We've since shifted our focus entirely to Micro, 
a platform for cloud native development which includes a server, command line and service framework (previously go-micro). Go Micro is now 
a standalone framework for anyone who needs it and moved to [Nitro](https://github.com/asim/nitro) for clarity.
